
Problem 1:    

                 Write a program to get a number from the user and print the  
                  reverse of it.

                 Note - Do not Use Arrays. Use only (+,-,*./,%) operators.

Problem 2:

                 Write a program to print total number of THREE digit Prime 
                  numbers

Problem 3:

                 Write a Program to Print the largest eight digit prime number

Problem 4:

                 Write a program to find out the total number of prime numbers 
                 below 100,000,000 have the sum of their digits equal to 14?

Problem 5:

                 Write a program to get a user input as Integer variable using 
                  “scanf”. Convert the integer into character string and print the 
                  same as string  using “printf”. Do not use any library functions 
                  except scanf & printf.

                          // declare variables
                          printf("Enter Number : ");
                          scanf("%d",&x);
                         // write the code
                          printf("Entered Number = ");
                          printf("%s\n",y);


Problem 6:

                 Write a program to get TWO numbers from user up to 50 digit 
                 each and print the sum of the numbers. The numbers can be 
                 negative. Use functions to implement this.

                  Note:	
                         Do not accept Invalid numbers
                         Do not print leading zeros
                         Each number can be of different digit

Problem 7:

                 Write a Calculator program which will give "Calc" prompt and 
                 always stay on this prompt. When user types one of the 
                 following  command, the program will calculate and give result. 
                 Typing "Exit" will exit from the Calculator program. This 
                 program accepts up to 50 digit number. Division will give         
                 quotient  and remainder.

Calc> 12345678967354748+9876546877687678678678678	     - Addition
Calc> 12345678995387837883748798-8738478937937498237	- Subtraction
Calc> 123478763783847239874 * 34837472384723894732	- Multiplication
Calc> 1233489374983933498398095/3487384	- Division
Calc> Exit	- Quit

Note:
         Do not accept Invalid numbers
         Do not print leading zeros
         Use functions and write a professional program use Linux coding style
         Each number can be of different digit 
         Make sure that all the Input conditions are take care
         Try to minimize the execution speed	

Problem 8:

                 Create a sample linked list with about 5 entries using the                
                 following  structure.  Insert a new entry before or after a given id.
                 Delete an entry of a given id.

                 Menu Items

                 1. Insert Entry
                 2. Delete Entry
                 3. Display List
                 4. Exit

             struct student {
                         int id;
                         int Maths;
                         int Science;
                         struct student *next;
                        }
